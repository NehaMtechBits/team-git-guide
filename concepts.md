ðŸ’¡ The Big Picture: Core Git Concepts
Don't worry about commands yet. Just understand these ideas. Think of Git as a special photo album for our project.

Repository (Repo): The entire project folder. It's the "photo album" that contains all our code and its entire history.

Commit: A snapshot or a "save point" of your code at a specific moment in time. It's like taking a "photo" of your work. Every commit has a unique ID and a message describing what you changed.

Branch: A parallel timeline of your project. We use branches to work on new features without messing up the main, stable version of our code. Our main timeline is called main.

Merge: The act of combining the changes from one branch into another. It's like taking the story from your parallel timeline and adding it to the main story.

Remote (like GitHub): A shared copy of the repository that lives on a server (in our case, GitHub). It's the central place where we all sync our work.

Pull Request (PR): A request to merge your changes from your branch into the main branch. It's a way to ask for a code review before your work gets combined with the main project.
