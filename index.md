# ðŸš€ Welcome to Our Git & GitHub Guide
Hello team! This guide is our new single source of truth for how we build software together.

**Why are we doing this?**
To solve common problems we face:

- Accidentally overwriting each other''s work.
- Confusion about which version of the code is the ''latest'' or ''correct'' one.
- Difficulty tracking changes and finding out why a certain change was made.
- A messy and inconsistent development process.

This guide will teach you the fundamentals of Git and the exact workflow we will follow. Let''s get started!

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following tools installed and configured:
1.  **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** (run `git config` with your name and email)
2.  **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** (or your preferred editor)
3.  **[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)** (run `gh auth login`)
