'# ðŸš€ Welcome to Our Git & GitHub Guide
Hello team! This guide is our new single source of truth for how we build software together.

**Why are we doing this?**
To solve common problems we face:

- Accidentally overwriting each other''s work.
- Confusion about which version of the code is the ''latest'' or ''correct'' one.
- Difficulty tracking changes and finding out why a certain change was made.
- A messy and inconsistent development process.

This guide will teach you the fundamentals of Git and the exact workflow we will follow. Let''s get started!
