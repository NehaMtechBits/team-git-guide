### ## Useful Commands for Navigation

These commands help you see where you are and what has happened.

| Command                      | Description                                                        |

### ## Deeper Concept: `git fetch` vs. `git pull`

This is an important difference to understand as you get more comfortable with Git.

| Command                | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git fetch origin`     | **Downloads without merging:** Fetches all new changes from the remote but doesn't apply them. This is a safe way to review updates before merging them into your work. |
| `git pull origin main` | **Downloads AND merges:** A shortcut that runs `git fetch` and `git merge` in one step. It's more direct but less controlled.                                           |
