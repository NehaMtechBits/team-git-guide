# The Difference Between Git and GitHub

Although they're often used together, Git and GitHub are two different things. Understanding the difference is very important.

### Git: The Tool üõ†Ô∏è

**Git is a version control software.** It‚Äôs a tool that you install on your computer to track changes in your code.

- It works completely **offline**.
- It‚Äôs the core engine that handles creating commits, branches, and merging.
- Think of Git like a word processing application (like Microsoft Word). It‚Äôs the program you use to write and save different versions of your document.

### GitHub: The Service ‚òÅÔ∏è

**GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories.** It‚Äôs a place on the internet where you store your project‚Äôs code and collaborate with others.

- It‚Äôs a platform built **around** Git.
- It adds powerful features on top of Git, like Pull Requests, issue tracking, and user management.
- Think of GitHub like a social network or cloud storage service for your documents (like Google Docs or Dropbox). It‚Äôs where you upload your documents to share them, get feedback, and work with others.

### ## A Simple Analogy

- **Git** is the software.
- **GitHub** is the social network for the software.

You use **Git** on your computer, and you use **GitHub** to share your work and collaborate with your team.
